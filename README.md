# Aircrew_Back_Pain Analysis
**In-depth statistical analysis of aircrew back pain survey results using SPSS**<br/>

üöÅ **Background**<br/>

Back Pain in military aviation, particularly helicopters, is a known problem. Most reasearch and money is spent on providing solutions for pilots while largely ignoring back pain in aircrew who fly in the back of the aircraft. The MH-60S Naval helicopter utilizes troop and gunner seats dating back to the Vietnam era. While the aircraft is relatively new (within the last 10 years), the seats were not updated from previous helicopter types. This has resulted in significant back related issues including permenant disability for aircrewmen who fly in the back of the aircraft.<br/>

To address this issue I initiated a back pain survey that was sent out to all current MH-60S and MH-60R pilots and aircrew. I received over 500 responses to the survey which can be reviewed in the "Back Pain in H-60s Response" spreadsheet. Data was analyzed using SPSS to determine if there was a significant difference in back pain between pilots and aircrew in the MH-60S aircraft. The results of this analysis were used along with numerous aviation safety hazard reports to procure funding and eventual development of the Improved Aircrew Endurance Seat.<br/>
